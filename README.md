### 🏗️ Engineering Philosophy
* **Sovereignty by Design:** Our stack is hosted exclusively on EU-sovereign infrastructure to eliminate exposure to the US CLOUD Act.
* **Hardened Architecture:** We employ rigorous production sanitization, including the removal of internal metadata and strict API perimeter defense.
* **High-Signal Execution:** We prioritize robust, type-safe systems (Python/Django & React/TS) that handle complex geospatial computations at scale.
